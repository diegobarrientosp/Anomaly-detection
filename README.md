# 🚀 Anomaly Detection in Industrial Data  

This repository explores **anomaly detection techniques** applied to industrial process data.  
I am passionate about **Chemical Engineering** and how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can enhance **process automation, predictive maintenance, and system optimization**.  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project implements **three different machine learning models** for anomaly detection:  
- **🌳 Isolation Forest** – A tree-based unsupervised learning approach.  
- **🛑 One-Class SVM** – A kernel-based method for detecting deviations.  
- **🔍 Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** – A density-based method identifying local anomalies.  

The dataset consists of **simulated industrial process variables**, including **temperature, pressure, and flow rate**, with artificial anomalies introduced to test model performance.

## 📊 Results and Insights  
Each model was evaluated using **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**, with the best-performing model identified based on **detection accuracy**.  
The project highlights:
- **Comparative analysis of anomaly detection models**.  
- **Visualizations of detected anomalies** in industrial process data.  
- **Evaluation of model performance based on real-world considerations**.  

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
As a **Chemical Engineer**, I am continuously exploring how **AI, automation, and machine learning** can be integrated into **chemical and industrial processes**.  
This project is part of my **learning journey** to enhance my skills in **data-driven decision-making, industrial automation, and process optimization**.
